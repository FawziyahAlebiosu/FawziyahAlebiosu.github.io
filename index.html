<p>Hi, I'm currently a senior in college (graduating in Spring 2022) who's fascinated with people and several topics in computing. I like asking questions about building technology platforms in the intersection of education and access. 

I've gotten the opportunity to explore my fascinations while interning on the technology team at IssueVoter, where I used Python & Javascript to work on several features. I participated in the Major League Hacking fellowship. Before that, I interned at FWD.us, where I worked on <a href = "https://www.informedimmigrant.com">informedimmigrant.com</a> as well as an internal tool that utilizes Twitter's API.
Most of my free time is spent working mainly on <a href = "https://github.com/FawziyahAlebiosu"> class projects </a>,and learning about <a href = "https://github.com/FawziyahAlebiosu/Flashcard_Android_App-v1"> android development.</a> The rest of it is spent listening to podcasts, being  on the internet or doing calculus.
If you're interested in my resume, check out <a href = "Fawziyah_Alebiosu_Resume_2021.pdf">this document.</a>
<br>
Finally, if you'd like to start a virtual conversation, or set up an in-person one (preferably over tea), feel free to email me at fawziyah[dot]alebiosu [at] gmail [dot] com.

Cheers,<br>
Fawziyah
