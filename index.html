	<br>
<p>	Hi, I'm currently a Software Engineer living and working in the Bay Area. I currently do a lot of backend and API development on a Payments Facilitation team at GoDaddy. In simple terms, we work on the code that powers the entire flow from when merchants who transact with GoDaddy Payments devices and online channels are assessed fees for each transaction, to when they receive their money, and all the miscallenous steps between both stages. I graduated with my Computer Science degree in the Spring of 2022. I am incredibly fascinated by people and several topics in computing. I like asking questions about building technology platforms in the intersection of education and access. 
<br>
	In undergrad, I've gotten the opportunity to explore my fascinations while interning on the technology team at IssueVoter, where I used Python & Javascript to work on several features. I participated in the Major League Hacking fellowship. Before that, I interned at FWD.us, where I worked on <a href = "https://www.informedimmigrant.com">informedimmigrant.com</a> as well as an internal tool that utilizes Twitter's API.
<br>
	Most of my free time is spent writing, reading books on my kindle, and playing tennis. The rest of it is spent listening to podcasts, being  on the internet or lifting heavy weights at the gym!

	Finally, if you'd like to start a virtual conversation, or set up an in-person one (preferably over tea), feel free to email me at fawziyah[dot]alebiosu[at]gmail [dot] com.

Cheers,<br>
Fawziyah
